# HealthUp
A project for Launchology Vision hackathon

## INTRODUCTION

We have created an web application to track blood pressure and blood sugar levels daily along with the current medications used by the user. This data is processed to give a beautiful chart of bp and sugar level records and gives the user insights of their medical conditions and effectiveness of medications they use in a long run.
This is a prototype code with minimal features and it can be taken as a backbone for a full fledged application.

## TECH STACK USED

* FRONTEND: EJS view engine, CSS
* BACKEND: NodeJS, Express
* DATABASE: MySQL

## INSTALLATION

The steps for installation of the app and running in localhost are:
1. Git clone the app in desired directory.
2. cd to the directory.
3. Create a MySQL database in your localhost and a table in the database using `userTableStruct.sql` script.
4. Change `.env.txt` file to '.env' file.
5. Update the .env file with appropriate information.
6. Run `npm i` to install appropriate node modules for the project.
7. Finally run `npm start` to run the server on localhost.
8. In your browser open `localhost:<port_no>` to run your application.
